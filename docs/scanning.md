# Scanning

fdu has a summary scan and an indexed scan. The summary reports one row per
immediate child directory. The indexed scan builds the tree used by the browser
and deletion planner.

## Accounting and traversal

- Allocated bytes are the default; apparent mode uses logical file lengths.
- Directory inode storage is excluded. Hardlinked paths count separately.
- Hidden and ignored names are included. fdu does not apply ignore-file rules.
- `-x PATH` / `--exclude PATH` omits an exact path relative to the selected root
  and its subtree. Repeat the option for multiple paths; matching is by path
  component, not by substring. These exclusions apply to summary and browser
  scans, and are not accepted with `--rmrf`. Browser directories that contain
  omitted paths are marked incomplete, so browser deletion keeps them and
  removes the entries around the omitted paths.
- Discovered symlinks are leaves. Files and directories beyond a filesystem or
  mount boundary are not traversed.
- Errors and unsupported directory aliases make affected totals incomplete.
  Root open or enumeration errors stop the scan.
- The tree is live rather than an atomic snapshot, so concurrent filesystem or
  mount changes can be observed during a scan.

Summary output orders immediate child directories by descending size. On Linux
the summary scanner uses four Rayon workers by default; `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`
sets another count. The macOS summary scanner is sequential.

An immediate child that is itself a mount boundary is labeled `MOUNT BOUNDARY`
on both platforms. The warning reports excluded boundaries. Contents below
mount boundaries are omitted from totals.

## Indexed scan

The shared indexed scanner uses worker-local directory queues and work stealing.
It batches entries and completion events over the browser's bounded channel.
Platform code supplies enumeration, metadata, mount identity, and pool limits.
Linux sizes a shared descriptor retention budget from its file descriptor limit,
reserving capacity for temporary opens and other process descriptors. The budget
covers active workers, queues, and unpublished batches. A worker that cannot
retain a descriptor records the
directory's names and identities from the root and reopens it later without
waiting for a permit. Reopening uses at most two temporary descriptors per
worker and checks every ancestor's identity and mount without following
symlinks. A renamed or replaced ancestor can therefore make a deferred directory
incomplete, even when its original directory remains accessible elsewhere.

See [`indexed.rs`](../crates/fdu-scan/src/indexed.rs),
[`linux.rs`](../crates/fdu-scan/src/linux.rs), and
[`macos.rs`](../crates/fdu-scan/src/macos.rs).

Linux requires kernel 6.0 or later. Its indexed scan compares device and kernel
mount IDs; the summary scanner uses `openat2` with `RESOLVE_NO_XDEV` where
available and a descriptor mount-ID fallback. macOS compares device,
filesystem ID, and mount point from opened directory descriptors. These checks
cannot make traversal atomic with concurrent mount or path changes.
