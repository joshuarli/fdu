# fdu

`fdu` scans disk usage and lets you browse a directory in a terminal. It
supports Linux 6.0 or later and macOS 26 or later; published macOS builds are
for Apple silicon.

## Install

Download the archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/laputa-systems/fdu/releases):

- macOS arm64: `fdu-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip`
- Linux x86_64: `fdu-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.zip` or
  `fdu-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-static.zip`
- Linux arm64: `fdu-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.zip` or
  `fdu-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-static.zip`

The Linux `-static` archive does not need a musl dynamic loader. Extract the
archive, then put its executable on your `PATH`; for example:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
unzip fdu-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip
install -m 755 fdu-aarch64-apple-darwin ~/.local/bin/fdu
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Use the matching executable name from the archive you downloaded.
The export applies to the current shell; add it to your shell startup file to
keep `~/.local/bin` on `PATH` in new sessions.

## Run

```text
fdu [--apparent] [-x PATH | --exclude PATH]... [--summary | --interactive] [--read-only] [PATH]
fdu --rmrf [--yes] PATH
```

With no path, fdu scans the current directory. In a terminal it opens the
browser; when stdin or stdout is redirected it prints a summary. Use
`--summary` to select summary output explicitly. `--interactive` requires
terminal input and output.

Use `-x PATH` or `--exclude PATH` to omit an exact path beneath the selected
root, including its subtree. Exclusion paths are relative to the selected root;
repeat the option to omit more paths. Path components must match exactly.
In the browser, directories whose contents include excluded paths are marked
incomplete and cannot be deleted as a whole.

By default, sizes are filesystem-allocated bytes; `--apparent` uses logical
file lengths. Use `--read-only` to disable deletion in the browser. The summary
prints each included immediate child directory in descending size order as a
compact size (such as `5G` or `2.4M`), a tab, and a quoted name. Sizes use
1024-based units. Root-level files are not listed; mount boundaries are labeled
separately. Warnings report skipped entries or boundaries. Hidden names are
included, and fdu does not read `.gitignore`.

The supplied root path may resolve through symlinks; the browser shows
discovered symlinks beneath it as entries and never follows them.
Nested filesystem or mount boundaries are skipped and reported. Results
describe a live scan, not an atomic snapshot.

### Browser keys

- Move with arrows or `j`/`k`; open with Enter, right, or `l`; go up with
  left, Backspace, or `h`. Page Up/Down and Home/End move through a listing.
- Press `d` to mark an entry, `v` to start or end a range, `*` to mark
  matching entries, and `c` to clear marks.
- Press `s` to sort by name or size, `a` to switch size modes, `r` to
  rescan, and `/` to filter names in the current directory.
- Marked entries appear in a second pane. Tab changes panes; `-` changes
  between side-by-side and stacked layout. In the marked pane, `d` removes a
  mark and Enter shows it in the listing.
- To delete marks, focus the marked pane and press Ctrl-R. Review the prompt
  and press Enter to delete permanently or Esc to cancel. There is no Trash.
- Press `?` for in-app help, or `q` or Ctrl-C to quit.

### Empty a directory

`--rmrf` permanently deletes every entry below the explicit path and leaves
the directory itself in place. Exclusions cannot be combined with `--rmrf`. It
is unavailable in summary-only builds.

- A symlink as the final path component is refused, including when the path
  has trailing slashes. Earlier path components may resolve through symlinks.
  The filesystem root, home directory, and any parent of the current directory
  are refused.
- Symlinks below the path are unlinked, never followed.
- On a terminal, fdu shows the resolved path and entry count and requires the
  exact answer `yes`. `--yes` skips the prompt and is required when stdin is
  not a terminal.
- An incomplete root scan, incomplete selected directory, or nested mount
  rejects the deletion plan before any entry is removed.
- Only entries found by the scan are attempted. A child created after scanning
  is left in place; concurrent filesystem changes can affect the result.

### Environment

- `LS_COLORS` controls browser colors.
- On Linux, `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` sets the summary scanner's worker count
  (default: 4).
